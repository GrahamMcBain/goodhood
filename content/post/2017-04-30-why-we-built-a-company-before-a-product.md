The hardest part about making the transition to your post college life is that it means getting a new circle of friends. You find yourself getting into a routine, not going out as much and not meeting anyone new. Most of us will  just end up not make new friends, and that’s sad. 

The real secret to living a happy fulfilling life is making friends with your neighbors. As we grow older many of us will drift away from the friends we party with and start to form relationships at work or through our kids. These relationships are great but they require a lot of work to maintain. And eventually all but the closest of those friendships fall away.

Unlike work and party friends, you’ll probably have a lot in common with most of the people who live in your hood. You’ll be in similar financial situations, you maybe at a similar stage of life, and some of them will have kids, or be planning too.

Neighbor friends will be less concerned about your job, what you wear, and what music you’re into. What they will really care about is if you’re kind, unpretentious, and open to trying out their cooking. When friendships are based on proximity not affinity, you focus more on what really matters.

  
Neighbor friends have a ton of advantages. You can walk to their house, have a lot to drink and stumble home. If you get to a party at their house and forget something, just walk home and grab it. The best part about neighbor friends is that they WANT to be your friend as much as you do.

The main reason most people aren’t friends with their neighbors is because they’re afraid to put themselves out there. Once you get the ball rolling however quickly picks up speed. Before you know it you’ll be having block parties, group walks, and play dates to your hearts content.

Your home life doesn’t have to be the siloed, individualistic hells cape that it’s made out to be. You can design your neighborhood community to be the kind of place everyone wants to live.

Clearly there can be downsides to making friends with your neighbors, when you have a falling out it can get awkward. But it’s like they say, better to have loved and lost right? 

What’s more, when you have created a community full of people you love and trust you’ll never want to move. You’ll stop browsing zillow for a slightly better house in a slightly better area. And you’ll start to live life the way it was meant to be lived. In a tight knit community of humans who all feel a sense of love and belonging.
